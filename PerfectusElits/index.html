            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>

                Air pollution, primarily from sources like transportation, industrial processes,<br> and residential
                heating, is a major global health crisis, causing around 7 million <br>spremature deaths annually. Fine
                particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is particularly <br>dangerous due to its ability to penetrate deep
                into the lungs and bloodstream,<br> leading to severe health issues such as stroke, heart disease, and
                lung cancer.<br> Addressing this problem is crucial not only for improving public health but also for
                <br>combating climate change, as both share common pollution sources.

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>The proposed solution is an innovative air filtration system that employs electrostatic forces generated
                through<br> friction to capture fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) without the need for high
                voltages. This system utilizes<br> a motor to create a continuous electrostatic charge between friction
                plates and a filter, effectively removing <br>harmful particles from the air. It includes sensors to
                monitor air quality and adjust the system's performance in real time, providing a cost-efficient,
                low-maintenance alternative to traditional HEPA filters. By improving air quality, this technology can
                significantly enhance public health and support environmental sustainability.</p>
